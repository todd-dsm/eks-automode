# EKS Auto Mode Implementation Strategy - Final Report

**Project**: eks-automode Terraform Infrastructure  
**Date**: July, 2025  
**Assessment**: Architecture Review and Implementation Recommendations  
**Status**: Ready for Production Implementation

---

## Assessment Summary

**Recommendation: Proceed with the architectural vision using a staged deployment approach.**

the concept of separated NodePools for infrastructure services (Istio, Vault, Signoz) versus client applications represents modern Kubernetes best practices and aligns perfectly with EKS Auto Mode capabilities. The current Terraform error is a timing issue, not an architectural flaw, and is easily resolved.

**Key Findings:**

- ✅ Architecture is excellent and production-ready
- ✅ Perfect fit for EKS Auto Mode + Karpenter capabilities  
- ✅ Billing separation strategy is sound and implementable
- ✅ Web-form-to-cluster vision is achievable
- ⚠️ Current implementation needs timing refinement

---

## Problem Analysis

### Current Error

```shell
Error: Failed to construct REST client
with module.eks.kubernetes_manifest.nodepool_infra_services,
cannot create REST client: no client config
```

### Root Cause

Classic Terraform + Kubernetes timing issue where:

1. `kubernetes_manifest` resources try to connect to EKS cluster
2. EKS cluster isn't fully ready for API connections
3. Kubernetes provider fails to establish REST client

### Why This Happens with EKS Auto Mode

- Auto Mode has different initialization patterns than traditional EKS
- Control plane + compute config initialization timing varies
- Provider connection issues weren't present in traditional EKS deployments

---

## Architecture Validation

### ✅ **the Vision is Sound**

#### Workload Separation Strategy

```yaml
Infrastructure NodePool:
  - Istio (service mesh)
  - Vault (secrets management)
  - Signoz (observability)
  - Ingress controllers
  - Monitoring stack

Client Applications NodePool:
  - Business applications
  - User-facing services
  - Custom workloads
  - Development environments
```

#### Benefits Achieved

- **Resource Isolation**: Prevents noisy neighbor issues
- **Security Boundaries**: Different security policies per workload type
- **Billing Transparency**: Clear cost attribution and chargeback capability
- **Performance Predictability**: Guaranteed resources for critical infrastructure
- **Scaling Independence**: Each pool scales based on workload demands

#### EKS Auto Mode Compatibility

EKS Auto Mode explicitly supports this approach:

- Built-in NodePools: `["general-purpose", "infra-services, data-services"]`
- Custom NodePools: Fully supported via Karpenter integration
- Billing separation: Native support through tagging and cost allocation

---

## Implementation Solution

Staged Deployment

### Update Makefile

```makefile
# Enhanced staged deployment
deploy-staged:
	@echo "=== Stage 1: Core Infrastructure ==="
	@terraform apply -target=module.network -auto-approve
	@terraform apply -target=module.eks -auto-approve
	@echo "=== Waiting for cluster readiness ==="
	@scripts/wait-for-cluster.sh
	@echo "=== Stage 2: Kubernetes Resources ==="
	@terraform apply -auto-approve

# Single command for end users (orchestrates staging)
deploy-client: tfvars init deploy-staged post-deploy-verification
```

#### Cluster Readiness Script

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/wait-for-cluster.sh

echo "⏳ Waiting for EKS cluster to be fully ready..."

max_attempts=30
attempt=1

while [ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]; do
    echo "Attempt $attempt/$max_attempts: Testing cluster connectivity..."
    
    if aws eks describe-cluster --name ${project} --region ${region} \
       --query 'cluster.status' --output text | grep -q "ACTIVE"; then
        echo "✅ Cluster is ACTIVE, testing API connectivity..."
        
        aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ${project} --region ${region}
        
        if kubectl get nodes --request-timeout=10s >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "✅ Cluster API is responsive"
            break
        fi
    fi
    
    echo "⏳ Cluster not ready yet, waiting 30 seconds..."
    sleep 30
    attempt=$((attempt + 1))
done

if [ $attempt -gt $max_attempts ]; then
    echo "❌ Cluster failed to become ready within timeout"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Timeline**: 45 minutes  
**Risk**: Very Low  
**Benefit**: Production-ready, reliable deployment

#### Application Deployment Examples

```yaml
# Infrastructure workloads
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: istio-gateway
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-type: infrastructure
      tolerations:
      - key: workload-type
        value: infrastructure
        effect: NoSchedule

---
# Client applications
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: client-web-app
  namespace: production
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-type: applications
```

**Timeline**: 2-3 sprints  
**Risk**: Low  
**Benefit**: Full separation, billing transparency, optimal resource allocation

## SaaS Platform Integration

### Web Form to Cluster Vision

#### Current State Assessment

**Achievable**: ✅ 100% feasible with current architecture  
**Timeline**: 3-6 months for full automation  
**Complexity**: Medium (orchestration layer needed)

#### Implementation Strategy

```python
# Web form handler (conceptual)
def deploy_client_cluster(form_data):
    # Generate environment-specific build.env
    config = generate_build_env(form_data)
    
    # Orchestrated deployment (hides complexity from user)
    cluster_info = orchestrate_deployment(config)
    
    # Return ready-to-use cluster endpoints
    return {
        'cluster_endpoint': cluster_info.endpoint,
        'kubeconfig': cluster_info.kubeconfig,
        'monitoring_url': f"https://grafana.{cluster_info.domain}",
        'estimated_monthly_cost': calculate_cost(config)
    }

def orchestrate_deployment(config):
    # Stage 1: Core Infrastructure
    deploy_core_infrastructure(config)
    wait_for_cluster_ready()
    
    # Stage 2: Custom NodePools and Applications
    deploy_kubernetes_resources(config)
    
    # Stage 3: Validation and Handoff
    validate_deployment()
    return cluster_endpoints
```

#### User Experience Flow

```shell
# User perspective: Single button click
1. Fill web form (client name, environment, requirements)
2. Click "Deploy Cluster"
3. Wait 25-30 minutes
4. Receive cluster credentials and monitoring URLs

# Behind the scenes: Orchestrated stages
1. Generate terraform.tfvars from form data
2. Deploy network + EKS cluster (Stage 1)
3. Wait for cluster readiness
4. Deploy NodePools + applications (Stage 2)
5. Validate deployment and send notifications
```

## Billing and Cost Management

### Separation Strategy

```yaml
Tag Strategy:
  Infrastructure NodePool:
    cost-center: "shared-services"
    billing-team: "platform"
    workload-type: "infrastructure"
    
  Client Applications NodePool:
    cost-center: "client-projects"
    billing-team: "development"
    workload-type: "applications"
    client-id: "${client_name}"
```

### Cost Allocation Methods

1. **AWS Cost Explorer**: Filter by tags for detailed reporting
2. **Third-party tools**: Kubecost, Datadog, New Relic
3. **Custom reporting**: Extract metrics via Kubernetes APIs
4. **Chargeback automation**: Automated billing reports per client

### Expected Cost Benefits

- **Spot instances**: 60-90% savings for development workloads
- **Right-sizing**: Automatic instance selection reduces over-provisioning
- **Resource isolation**: Prevents resource waste from noisy neighbors
- **Billing transparency**: Clear attribution enables optimization
